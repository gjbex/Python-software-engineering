# Design patterns

Code to illustrate some design patterns in Python.

## What is it?

1. `decorator_design_pattern.ipynb`: notebook that illustrate how decorators
   can be used to change the behaviour of objects.
1. `factory_design_pattern.ipynb`: notebook illustrating how a factory class
   can be used to conveniently construct many objects with the same properties.
1. `iterator_design_pattern.ipynb`: illustration of the iterator design pattern
   (as well as the factory pattern).
1. `strategy_design_pattern.ipynb`: notebook illustrating how a strategy
   design pattern can simplify simulations. 
1. `state_machine_design_pattern.ipynb`: notebook illustrating how a state
   machine can be implemented in Python.
1. `finite-state-parser`: illustration of object-oriented data
    representation and the state pattern.
