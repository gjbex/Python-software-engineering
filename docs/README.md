Quality of software matters, whether you share it with others or not.
Software should be easy to install, easy to use, and well documented.
This training will cover those aspects from the perspective of the
Python ecosystem.  However, it is also important that software is easy
to maintain, so coding style matters, API-level documentation should be
available, as well as a battery of tests to ensure the software's
integrity.  Of course, good design is at least as important.


## Learning outcomes

When you complete this training you will

  * know some best practices for writing quality code;
  * catch errors at development time by using type annotations in your
    code;
  * know how to handle errors;
  * know how to systematically test your code;
  * know how to document your code;
  * be able to use objected-oriented programming to improve
    the reuse of your code;
  * be able to use functional programming concepts to improve
    your coding style;
  * aware that you can use design patterns to avoid reinventing
    the wheel.

## Training materials

Slides are available in the
 [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gjbex/Python-software-engineering),
as well as example code and hands-on material.


## Target audience

This training is for you if you want robust software that is easy
to understand and maintain.


## Prerequisites

You will need experience programming in Python.  This is not a training that starts
from scratch.

If you plan to do Python programming in a Linux or HPC environment you should
be familiar with these as well.
